If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

1. It must be tagged as a `bug`, a `feature request`, or a significant problem
   with `documentation` (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
2. If the issue is clearly with a single sub-component it should be tagged as
   such.  Use one of the following tags:
    - `tfjs-layers`
    - `tfjs-core`
3. The form below must be filled out.
4. It should not be a support request.

**Here's why we have that policy**: TensorFlow.js developers respond to issues. We
want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and
adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands
of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an
interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
